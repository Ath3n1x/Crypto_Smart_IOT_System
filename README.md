# Crypto_Smart_IOT_System
Attempt at designing a smart IOT system with Federating learning and cryptographic techniques.

✔	Implement Federated Learning for energy consumption prediction.



✔	Secure communication and data integrity using cryptographic tools:



  ✔	Digital Signatures for authenticity.


  
  ✔	Symmetric Encryption for confidentiality.



  
  ✔	Key Exchange Algorithms for secure key sharing (Diffie-Hellman).





  
  ✔	Hash Functions for integrity checks.



NOTE: We designed this as part of our academic pursuit of Cryptography. Therefore there is no real implementation of IOT services with Hardware. The project can only be complete with the integration of IOT with rasberry Pi and federated learning which we are in the process of implementing. 
You are welcome to reach out for any advices, collab reqs or suggestions. We are interested in expanding the project with the intention of academic publication. We are ready to provide the necessary resources.
